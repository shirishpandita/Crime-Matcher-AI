# 🧠 Crime Pattern Matcher AI  
🌐 **Live App:** [Click here to try it out](https://crime-matcher-ai-giwfu2cgcv7sndfjntesqw.streamlit.app)
An intelligent system to identify and visualize similar crime patterns using natural language input, semantic AI, and geolocation — focused on Jammu & Kashmir.

⚠️ The map and similarity matching might take up to 1–2 minutes to load depending on internet speed and server response. Please be patient — it's worth the wait! 😊

## 🚀 What It Does

🔍 **Input a crime report**, and it:

- Predicts the **type of crime** using Machine Learning  
- Finds **similar past crimes** using a **semantic similarity model (BERT)**  
- Shows **top 3 most relevant matches**  
- Plots crime locations on a **real-time map**  
- Lets you **download results** as CSV or PDF  

This tool could help in analyzing repetitive crime patterns, improve investigations, and support decision-making.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

This project was developed as part of my research interest in AI for forensic science and conflict analysis.  
It’s inspired by real-world crime analysis needs in politically sensitive regions like **Jammu & Kashmir**.  
And yes, I wanted it to be both **technically solid** and **practically useful**.

## 🧩 How It Works (Simple Flow)

1. Load dataset or upload your own
2. Use **BERT** to encode crime reports
3. Use **Logistic Regression** to classify crime type
4. Match your new report to past crimes using **cosine similarity**
5. Show **top 3 matches** with scores and info
6. Predict the most likely crime category
7. Plot crimes on **Folium map**
8. Let you **download** match results
